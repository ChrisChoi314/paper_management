## A tool to convert screenshots of arXiv ids to a spreadsheet

I built this tool because my advisor likes sending my group a bunch of images of arXiv papers she downloaded in her file management system. I would like a nice spreadsheet of links to the papers, the title of the paper, and perhaps the first 5 or so authors. You can find the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-tC1V30_PhzjYI9KfHs0ndhyOWf1RIImO97HepKWyZw/edit?usp=sharing)
